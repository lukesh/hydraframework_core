-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.0.2	Names are now generated if null. They will be the fully qualified name
		of the class plus @xxxxxx, where xxxxxx is a random number.
		
2.0.1	Fixed retrieve actor by interface bug.

2.0.0	Completely removed Flex dependency for Hydra. Events that trigger
		actor instantiation are now configurable via a HydraEventMap.
		
1.5.0	Compiled against Flex 4 SDK, including PageNavigation plugin in libs.

1.4.0	There are no breaking API changes, however internals not employ the use
		of the hydraframework_internal namespace, allowing developers to not 
		have to call super on overridden abstract methods.
		
		Commands now store a reference to the calling notification, and have
		.respond(), .cancel(), .complete() methods that create a new 
		Notification with the calling name and the appropriate response type. 

1.3.1	Overrode sendNotification() in SimpleCommand to pass the notification 
		to its listening Facade. This makes for more readable code and reduces 
		errors where the Command could send Notifications into the ether if the 
		developer used this.sendNotification and not 
		this.facade.sendNotification. It is now proper to use 
		this.sendNotification everywhere, even in Commands.
		
1.3.0	Various bugfixes to authentication and configuration core libs, but
		most significantly, implemented the as3commons ClassUtils for
		retrieving classes in the DelegateRegistry.
		
1.0.0	Promoted version 0.5.0 to a feature-complete official version 1.0.

0.5.0	Added basic IDelegate to the registries.delegate.interfaces.	

0.4.1	Added validation for duplicate actor registration in the Facade.  

0.4.0	Added support for a global DelegateRegistry. This does will not affect
		current implementations of the API, however adds the ability to
		register and retrieve delegates on a global level. If a Delegate is
		requested, and does not exist in the local delegate map, the Facade
		will attempt to return a globally-registered Delegate.

0.3.2	Added removeDelegatesByInterface() to the Facade.
		HydraFramework.initialize() returns the created instance of HydraCore.

0.3.1	Ensured that Commands and Delegates were returning a new instance on
		retrieveCommand and retrieveDelegate.
		
0.3.0	Restructured the HydraMVC implementation into the HydraFramework 
		project. Added plugin architecture to the system. Added a delegate map
		to the facade to facilitate an IoC implementation.
		
		Component must now implement IUIComponent. 
		
		Fixed a small event priority bug where request phased notifications
		would be handled after response phased if there was no latency in
		certain circumstances. 

0.2.0	Refactored initialization sequence. Facades may or may not require
		a view component, but it's recommended. If you don't bind a facade
		to a view component, you need to manually call initialize() and
		dispose().
		
		Mediators require a view component. They are to mediate between the MVC
		and the view, ipso facto requiring a view component. It is possible to
		rig the MVC if you want, but it isn't recommended.
		
		All events are FlexEvents now; this manages memory very well and has
		produced very clean memory footprints when adding and removing many
		components in tests.
		
		When a Facade is disposed, it calls dispose on all actors. When a
		Facade's view component is removed from the stage, it calls dispose()
		automatically. When it is added to the stage, it calls initialize()
		automatically. A Mediator is only truly removed from memory when its 
		Facade is removed. Proxies initialize() and dispose() with their
		Facades. If you're using a singleton proxy, be cognizant of this and
		know that initialize() will be called when any Facade to which it is
		registered initializes; the same applies to dispose().
		
		Added more documentation to core classes.
		
		Begun testing integration with De MonsterDebugger
		(http://demonsterdebugger.com/). This is our first step towards an
		external AIR debug console integration. We will need to experiment
		with memory management and performance implications first, however...

		
0.1.3	Upgraded priority of the FlexEvents that control initialization in
		Facade and Mediator. This allows them to register their event listeners
		in implementation before the view component fires any events.


0.1.2	Updated interfaces to include remove[Actor] methods and fix incorrect
		signatures. The Proxy now automatically fires initialize() and 
		dispose() methods. 
		
		Fixed a bug where everything would be disposed if the container needed 
		to spawn scrollbars. When you add components to a canvas, for example, 
		if the contents become too large for the canvas, the canvas creates
		scrollbars. The problem is that this process actually removes and re-
		adds the component to the stage, firing a REMOVED_FROM_STAGE event,
		triggering all the dispose() methods. We worked around this by trapping
		the REMOVED event, ensuring that the target was the component of the
		actor, and only disposing in that case. So far, this seems to work very
		well.
		
		
0.1.1	Added new generic REGISTER and REMOVE notifications for Facade, 
		Mediator, and Proxy. (Previously, you had to determine which actor
		sent the Relay.REGISTER or Relay.REMOVE notification.)


0.1.0	Initial release, code as-is for evaluation, contribution, 
		collaboration.
